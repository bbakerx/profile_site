            <p>I have a passion for creativity. I love writing recording and performing music. I play guitar, sing and I play drums. I am primarily a drummer.  I love drumming, it gives me a way to express my creative side. It gives me a voice I wouldn't have otherwise. In the last year and a half or so I have been getting into web design. I experimented with -</P>

        <ul>
            <li>Photoshop</li>
            <li>fireworks</li>
            <li>wordpress</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Now I am learning web development and taking it seriously.</p>

            <p>Design and coding gives me another way to be creative and express myself artistically. I am hoping to create web sites and web apps that will help other musicians in their lives. Hopefully this will turn into a future day job or freelance career that will allow more time in my life for my own music projects as well!</p>
